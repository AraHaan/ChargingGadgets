### 1.0.0 - *2020-0-0?*

#### Added
- The whole mod :grin:
- Adds a single block called the Charging Station (from Building Gadgets)
    - This block can charge any item that has a common energy capability
    - When broken this block will be dropped with it's energy stored so you don't lose it.
    - You can now power the block from other power mods :D
    - It no longer produces a light level
    - Shift clicking should be a little nicer in this version
    - We no longer void buckets... sorry
    - The GUI is a little nicer too :+1:
